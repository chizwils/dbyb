DesignsByDavenport brings you the look, quality and durability of those expensive tables big companies sell for much less!</span> <br><br> We make furniture that fits your space and your style. Since we have started, our shop has built furniture for clients from all over Texas and America, from law firm conference tables to ranch house cabins. Our lead time for your custom built furniture is 2-3 weeks. We know that you are anxious to start enjoying your new farmhouse furniture and we make every effort to get your furniture to you as soon as possible. However, quality does take some time. Your hand-crafted furniture is not built until you place your order. Each piece is built for you and built to last.<br><br> Our delivery charge starts at a low $20 for the Houston and surrounding metro area. Arrangements may also be made for delivery to other areas. Please call the shop at (832)892-6696 or email me at dxdavenport@gmail.com for pricing and questions. There is no deposit required to place an order and payment is not due until your custom furniture is finished and delivered. We look forward to hearing from you and appreciate the opportunity to make a one of a kind piece just for you.<br><br> Follow and like us on face book and Twitter for new pictures and ideas daily!
